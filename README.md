# Message Portal


Message Portal is a simple decentralized application (dapp) that allows users to write messages, which are then stored on the blockchain and displayed on the screen. The project showcases a basic version of a dapp that utilizes the Rinkeby Test Network as its underlying blockchain.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Powered Message Storage:** Message Portal utilizes blockchain technology to store user messages, ensuring secure and transparent message storage.

- **Rinkeby Test Network:** The smart contract for this project has been deployed to the Rinkeby Test Network, allowing for testing and development without using real Ether.

- **Message Display:** This version of the dapp displays messages stored on the blockchain in a user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

To interact with Message Portal, follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the Rinkeby Test Network:** Ensure that you are connected to the Rinkeby Test Network using an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask.

2. **Access the Dapp:** Open the Message Portal by navigating to [https://messageportal.netlify.app/](https://messageportal.netlify.app/).

3. **Write Messages:** Use the dapp interface to write and submit messages.

4. **View Messages:** Messages stored on the blockchain will be displayed on the screen.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (Rinkeby Test Network)
- **Smart Contract Language:** Solidity
- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Smart Contract Development:** Hardhat
- **Ethereum Interaction:** ethers.js


## Deployment

The smart contract has been deployed to the Rinkeby Test Network. But the Rinkeby has been depreciated by Ethereum recently, so we can't interact with the network now.
